    <p>Brazil, officially the Federative Republic of Brazil, is the largest country in both South America and Latin America. At 8.5 million square kilometers and with over 211 million people, Brazil is the world's fifth-largest country by area and the sixth most populous.</p>

    <h2>Historical Events</h2>
    <p>Europeans caused the death of many indigenous tribes. Europeans brought with them diseases that natives could not fight with due to their lack of immunity. Diseases like smallpox, measles, gonorrhea, tuberculosis, and influenza killed tens of thousands of indigenous people. In the early 18th century, Portugal was not doing too well after years of wars against Spain and the Netherlands, but had the chance to discover gold in Brazil. A gold rush started immediately, and the region where gold was extracted became known as the Minas Gerais (General Mines). Pedro II was removed from power on November 15, 1889, by a Republican military coup led by General Deodoro da Fonseca, who became Brazilâ€™s first president. The country was named Republic of the United States of Brazil, to be changed to Federative Republic of Brazil in 1967. However, it took a while until the country became a democracy.</p>
