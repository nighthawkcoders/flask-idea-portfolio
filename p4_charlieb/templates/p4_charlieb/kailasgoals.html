    <p class="font-weight-light">I was able to successfully make a repl.it playground working as a game, which is a main component in our project. However, I lost one point because I waited a long time to leard now to use IntelliJ and Github, although in the end I was able to complete that task.</p>
    <p class="font-weight-normal">Scrum Master Grading: </p>
    <p class="font-weight-light">1 - Become more familiar with Github and IntelliJ</p>
    <p class="font-weight-lighter">Kaila was able to learn to transfer the project from Repl.it to Github, then from Github to IntelliJ. She also learned how to update the file with commits</p>
