      The History of Tetris
    </p>

    <p class="important">
      Tetris (Russian: Тетрис [ˈtɛtrʲɪs]) is a tile-matching video game created by Russian software engineer Alexey Pajitnov in 1984. It has been published by several companies, most prominently during a dispute over the appropriation of the rights in the late 1980s. After a significant period of publication by Nintendo, the rights reverted to Pajitnov in 1996, who co-founded The Tetris Company with Henk Rogers to manage licensing. (Wikipedia)

    <h1>How to Play</h1>
    <p class="important">
      The Tetris playing field is a 10x20 grid. Your goal is to continually stack tetrominoes and clear lines as long as you can. To do that, you need to fill an entire line horizontally with blocks, causing those lines to disappear and giving you more space to stack.

    <h1>Impact on the Brain</h1>
    <p class="important">
      Tetris is one of the most widely-studied video games in psychology. The way it’s designed has helped us learn more about certain kinds of memory, along with attention and information processing. But one of the most fascinating things about it is the effect it has on the way you see the world. Several studies have shown that playing Tetris for a long time can influence your thought processes, mental images, and dreams. From what they could tell, the people who were most influenced by it were the ones who spent the most time playing it. They started to see the world through the lens of this video game.
