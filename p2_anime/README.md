Hi! This is our website project "Plants Please" by Andrew Zhang's group during fall 2020.
#Plants Please
Our website was an idea that one of our group mates had. Many people aspire to be plant parents but since it is hard to keep plants alive, especially beginners, we wanted to create a website that could educate aspiring plant owners on the easiest and hardest plants to keep and also some fun facts about plants. Our website includes a low maintenance plant page and a high maintenance plant page, as well as a SD friendly plant page, which will all educate the user on the best plants. We are creating a login database so that users can create an account and save their thoughts on plants they are considering or looking at. Our Interesting Plants page and Fruits and Veggie page serves as an informational gallery that can educate the users on plants that aren't for aesthetics.
#How to Use
This program is relatively easy to run. First, run app.py. In the app.py terminal, a linked IP address should appear. Click this link and it will guide you to our website. There is a navigation bar at the top that will allow you to go to any of our web pages. Most of our pages are still works in progress but please look forward to them as we finish and polish them.
#Current Pages
Our current web pages on the running site include:
* Home
* Low Maintenance Plants
* High Maintenance Plants
* SD Friendly Plants
* Fruits and Veggies
* Login/Sign up
* Interesting Plants
#Requirements (w.i.p.)
| Unit | Website Series Usage |
| -------- | ----------- |
|Big Idea: 1 Creative Development | Our website includes an image gallery with a cool design where you can click through. Our user database allows more interaction with website visitors as they can actually create an account to save their progress and thoughts on plants. |
|Big Idea: 2 Data | To create a login/signup page, we have to collect user input and store them in a database in order to allow username/password functions to exist. |
|Big Idea: 3 Algorithmns and Programs | Our navigation bar includes different web pages. We are also implementing a login/signup page that requires a database. |
|Big Idea: 4 Computing Systems and Programming | We are learning a lot of HTML/program usage (such as IntelliJ and Jinjja) and figuring out the intriqicies of the language and how diffrent parts communicate. |
|Big Idea: 5 Impact of Computing | |
*We will continue to add more to this section as we complete more of the pages*
